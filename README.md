**Project's Title:** Shopping Cart

**Project Description:**
The project contains the following:  

**An Image file:** The file for all the images of the products displayed on the shopping site.  

**A .VScode file:** The code was created with Visual Studio, so this file was automatically created to store the program information and allow the program to work.

**2 HTML Files:**  
**index.html:** This is the primary HTML that allows the homepage of the cart to be visible on the web. It contains the title 'Shopping Cart' and the link that references the style.css file and the used bootstrap icon page. It also features that would be. It has the class 'navbar,' the web page's navigation bar. It contains an inline anchor that denotes the hyperlink from the index.html file to the incart.html file (href).

**incart.html:** This file is the HTML file that leads to the cart. Whenever a customer adds things to the cart, they can view it by clicking the cart icon and be taken to this page. The href link in both HTML allows navigation between the two pages

**3 Java Script Files:**  

**cart.js:** This file adds the products to the page and features like product descriptions and the plus and minus icons that allow users to increase or decrease product quantity.  

**checkout.js:** The file is for the checkout cart page. The program has additional functions that will enable the price of each item to be calculated once added to the basket. And while they're in the basket, you can change the product's quantity, and the total price will update as needed.  

**product.js:** All product information; an id created for each product, their names, their images, their descriptions, their price.

**A CSS File:**  
**style.css:** Contains all the attributes of designs for the whole webpage. The navbar design, the cart icon design, the product's border size, color, fonts, margins, and cursor type/ function.  

**How to Use the Project:**  
To use/ edit project just download the zip file and you should be able to run it on any code editor that supports the programming languages used. 

**Improvement? or Additional features?:**  
There's probably a thousand ways you can think of improving this project and that's okay. This was my first time and I think so too. Additional features I am looking to add on this project would be a checkout page for users to input name, address, contact info, and card information. Also, a way to send user an email of their cart summary.
